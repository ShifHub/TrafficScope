# TrafficScope

After entering your earliest departure time(EDT), latest departure time(LDT), and latest time of arrival:
The application will calculate future estimated traffic times in 5 minute intervals between your EDT, and LDT.
You will leave and arrive, on time, at the most efficient times.

The app utilizes: Dynamic, and static table views. Special fonts, and custom views and headers. I hope you enjoy!

The only thing you will need to do before getting the app up and running on a device is add a swift file named
DarkSkyApiKey.swift copy and paste( public let DarkSkyApiKey = "cd2e76b4ddf8caddc438b5d133619b82" ) in that file.

This file is included in a .gitignore, to display that I know that sensitive information needs to be protected.
I'm not REALLY concerned with this API key being in the wrong hands, because there's no real potential for consequences.
