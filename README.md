# TrafficScope

This app finds the traffic times for a destination in 5 minute intervals between two different times.
A usual time, and the earliest possible time for departure.

The app utilizes: Dynamic, and static table views. Special fonts, and custom views and headers. I hope you enjoy!

The only thing you will need to do before getting the app up and running on a device is add a swift file named
DarkSkyApiKey.swift copy and paste( public let DarkSkyApiKey = "cd2e76b4ddf8caddc438b5d133619b82" ) in that file.

This file is included in a .gitignore, to display that I know that sensitive information needs to be protected.
I'm not REALLY concerned with this API key being in the wrong hands, because there's no real potential for consequences.
